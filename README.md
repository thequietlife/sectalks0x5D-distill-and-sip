TL; DR

Unsubscribe from email newsletters and use a RSS reader

Abstract:

💻 Before I grab my phone or open my laptop, where should I go to get my cyber security news before I get swamped by other people’s posts? Or before I just start doom scrolling and fall down rabbit holes and end up bookmarking articles for later that I then feel pressure to read or don’t get back to?
Saved articles in twitter, all my bookmarks  - when have I actually gone back to read them?

⏲️ What can I set up? Like the daily 5 min SANS Internet Stormcenter Daily Cyber Security Podcast

* Authoritative sources
* One place to get it
* To avoid doom scrolling 
* Time box to max 10 - 20 mins

🥃 In this talk I will show how I cut down the noise and distill my cyber security news intake.
